/**
 * Route transition veil.
 *
 * Panels of the same charcoal plaster as the page sweep up to cover the
 * outgoing route, the new route renders behind them, then the panels keep
 * travelling up to uncover it. One continuous upward motion, not a cover
 * followed by an unrelated uncover.
 *
 * ── Why it is built this way ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious implementation intercepts link clicks, calls preventDefault(),
 * animates, then router.push()es. That breaks two things: Next's <Link> never
 * gets its click, and — worse — neither does any component's own onClick, so
 * things like the navbar mega-menu would stop closing on navigate.
 *
 * So this listener never calls preventDefault(). Next navigates exactly as it
 * normally would, and the veil plays *concurrently*. The new route renders
 * while the screen is covered, which is why the veil doubles as a loading
 * screen for the heavy routes (/dashboard mounts a three.js scene).
 *
 * The listener runs in the CAPTURE phase so the veil starts on the same frame
 * as the click, before React's delegated handler at the root has run.
 *
 * A navigation that never completes is the one failure mode a cover transition
 * cannot recover from on its own, so VEIL_TIMEOUT_MS always lifts it.

 *
 * Two animation frames let React commit and the browser paint. Then
 * requestIdleCallback waits for the main thread to be free, which is exactly
 * "the new page has stopped doing work". Idleness is the right signal rather
 * than frame timing: frame rate is throttled in background tabs and on weak
 * hardware, so a frame-duration heuristic reports "busy" on pages that are
 * simply idle and over-holds the veil.
